# Test Count Explanation

## Why Different Numbers?

You're seeing different test counts because:

### 1. Initial Local Run (Outside Docker)
```
53 failed, 133 passed, 50 skipped = 236 total
```
This included some phantom/discovery failures because:
- No database existed locally
- Some tests failed to even start
- Import errors counted as failures

### 2. First Docker Run (After Cleanup)
```
35 failed, 132 passed, 49 skipped, 23 errors = 239 total
```
This was the real test count after:
- Running in proper Docker environment
- Tests could actually execute
- Errors separated from failures

### 3. Current State (Stable)
```
Total: 239, Passed: 172, Failed: 13, Errors: 5
```
This shows:
- Total failures = 13 + 5 = 18 (much better!)
- Pass rate improved from 56% to 72%
- Same 239 total tests

## Test Scope

### This is ONLY TEG Layer Tests
- Location: `AgentVault/agentvault_teg_layer_mvp/tests/`
- Count: 239 tests
- Does NOT include Registry tests

### Registry Tests (Separate)
- Registry A: ~200+ tests (estimated)
- Registry B: ~200+ tests (estimated)
- Run separately with:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it agentvault_registry_a pytest
  docker exec -it agentvault_registry_b pytest
  ```

### Total System Tests
```
TEG Layer:        239 tests
Registry A:       ~200 tests  
Registry B:       ~200 tests
Integration:      ~50 tests
----------------------------
Total System:     ~689+ tests
```

## The Improvement

What actually happened:
1. **Setup Issues Fixed**: No more "table not found" errors
2. **Real Failures Revealed**: Only 18 actual test failures
3. **Better Than Expected**: 72% pass rate is quite good!

The initial "53 failures" included many setup/environment issues that weren't real test failures. Once we ran tests in the proper Docker environment with pytest installed correctly, we see the true state: only 18 tests are actually failing.

---
**Bottom Line**: You went from a broken test environment to a working one with 72% of tests passing. The different numbers just reflect the journey from broken â†’ working setup.
