## Test Results

### Federation Configuration Status

#### Registry A (Port 8000)
- **Total Peers:** 8
- **Active Peers:** 2
  - European AgentVault Registry (`https://registry.agentvault.eu`)
  - Registry-B (`http://registry-b:8000`) âœ…

#### Registry B (Port 8001)
- **Total Peers:** 2
- **Active Peers:** 1
  - Registry-A (`http://registry-a:8000`) âœ…

**Result:** Registry A and Registry B are active peers of each other âœ…

### Agent Discovery Test Results

#### Total Agents Found via Registry B Federation
- **Total:** 55 agents
- **Local (Registry B):** 19 agents
- **Federated (from other registries):** 36 agents

#### Registry A Agents Successfully Discovered
All 5 agents from Registry A are visible when searching from Registry B:

### Specific Search Tests
Both targeted searches successfully found Registry A agents from Registry B:
- âœ… Search for "Premium Data Processor" - Found
- âœ… Search for "Sovereign Marketplace" - Found

## How Federation Works

1. **No Special Agent Configuration Required**
   - Agents don't need a "federated" flag
   - All active agents are automatically shared with federated peers

2. **Peer Relationship**
   - Registry A and B are configured as active peers
   - API keys are pre-configured in docker-compose.yml

3. **Discovery Process**
   - When searching with `include_federated=true`
   - Registry B queries Registry A's `/api/v1/internal/federation/query` endpoint
   - Results are combined and marked with `origin_registry_name`

---

## Using Federation

### Via API
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/agent-cards?include_federated=true" \
     -H "X-API-Key: avreg_d2yxb_VO1L9IieWEr4SF6oogMrOdNu2P7T3K5dKOcHk"
```

### Via UI
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8001
2. Use the search feature
3. Enable "Include Federated Results" checkbox
4. See agents from all federated registries!

---

## Conclusion

The AgentVault Federation system is fully operational. Agents registered in Registry A are successfully discoverable from Registry B through the federated network. The federation provides seamless cross-registry discovery without requiring any special configuration on individual agents.

**Federation Status: âœ… WORKING PERFECTLY**
